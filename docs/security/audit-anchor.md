# External audit-ledger anchoring

NazoAuth persists security events in the append-only `security_audit_events`
ledger and its durable outbox.  An independent `nazoauth audit-anchor-worker`
(or equivalent sidecar) claims that outbox in bounded batches and sends one
checkpoint per event to `AUDIT_ANCHOR_URL` over HTTPS. The exporter assigns
sequence and BLAKE3 hashes to committed events in immutable
`security_audit_chain_entries`, atomically with its bounded outbox claim. A
business transaction writes the event and outbox without locking the global
chain head. Retries reuse the assigned chain entry. The server process does
not run this exporter and does not receive its database role or sink secret.

The hash chain and its sequence belong to the deployment. HTTP security events
capture `payload.tenant_id` from the same immutable tenant context that routes
the request, before the event enters the shared writer queue. Concurrent
requests cannot exchange this context, and a conflicting tenant field is
rejected. Tenant-resource management events bind their tenant in the signed
operation and database transaction. Deployment events outside a tenant request
do not inherit the last request's identity.

Each request contains the checkpoint schema `nazo.audit.anchor.v1` and these
fields:

* `event_id` (also the `Idempotency-Key`);
* `deployment_id`, `sequence`, `previous_hash`, and `event_hash`;
* `event_type`, `event_category`, `payload`, and `occurred_at`.

The signed body is immutable for a given outbox row. The delivery timestamp is
carried separately in `X-Nazo-Audit-Sent-At`, so retries reuse the same body,
signature, and idempotency key. The empty ledger uses a stable
`genesis:<deployment_id>` idempotency key and an explicit `checkpoint_kind` of
`genesis`.

The receiver must recompute the BLAKE3 event hash before accepting a
checkpoint. The hash input is `nazo.audit.v1\0`, big-endian sequence, previous
hash, UUID bytes, length-prefixed UTF-8 event type and category, big-endian
microsecond timestamp, and length-prefixed PostgreSQL `jsonb::text` payload.
This makes the independent receiver, rather than the database writer alone,
the final authority for hash-chain validity.

The worker authenticates the exact JSON body with HMAC-SHA-256 in
`X-Nazo-Audit-Signature: sha256=<base64url>`. Only a 2xx response acknowledges
the outbox row; an idempotent receiver must return 2xx for a replay rather than
an ambiguous conflict response.
Transport and non-success responses are rescheduled with bounded exponential
backoff.  The response body is never logged, and the HMAC secret is never
included in logs or the checkpoint.

The worker records its observation and every externally accepted checkpoint in the shared audit chain state. Event acknowledgement and checkpoint advancement are one database operation. In `AUDIT_ANCHOR_MODE=required`, high-impact management preflight requires a recent worker observation, a valid deployment checkpoint, and oldest pending event age within `AUDIT_ANCHOR_MAX_LAG_SECONDS`. A bounded backlog is allowed, including committed events not yet chained. With no backlog the checkpoint must equal the chain head; historical delivery latency does not keep a recovered deployment unavailable. An empty ledger records its signed, externally accepted genesis checkpoint before required mode becomes ready. No instance-local health file is used.
`optional` and `disabled` do not read exporter health on management admission;
the durable writer availability check still applies. `disabled` is an explicit
development setting and provides no protection against a privileged local
attacker.

Delivery is deliberately strict and ordered: a permanently rejected earliest
checkpoint blocks later checkpoints. Operators must alert on `audit.anchor`
retries and repair the receiver contract or credentials. There is no skip/DLQ
operation because skipping would make a later external chain look complete
when it is not.

Recommended production separation:

* pre-create distinct lifecycle, server-writer, and exporter database roles;
* run `nazoauth migrate` with the lifecycle database URL and
  `NAZOAUTH_MIGRATION_RUNTIME_ROLE` naming the server-writer role; migration
  resets that role's direct `public` schema/table/sequence privileges, grants
  application DML, and grants only ledger append/check-availability functions;
* give the worker exporter role only chain assignment and outbox claim/ack/health rights;
* provide the worker `AUDIT_ANCHOR_DATABASE_URL` and `AUDIT_ANCHOR_TOKEN` (or
  its secret-file form), while the server receives only the deployment identity;
* protect the HTTPS receiver with append-only/WORM retention and verify its
  idempotency behavior independently.

This repository contains the worker protocol and shared database preflight logic;
it does not prove a deployed receiver's WORM guarantees, cross-host
availability, or real external acceptance.  Those require a deployment-level
probe and an independent receiver audit.

Database provisioning remains responsible for database `CONNECT`, removal of
`PUBLIC` schema `CREATE` and database temporary-table rights, and the exporter
function grants. Those are database-wide trust decisions and are not silently
changed by an application migration.

Worker configuration also includes `AUDIT_ANCHOR_MODE`, `DEPLOYMENT_ID`,
`AUDIT_ANCHOR_URL`, polling/request/freshness/lag
durations, bounded batch size, a positive lock timeout, and an optional
`AUDIT_ANCHOR_DATABASE_MAX_CONNECTIONS`. The server must never receive the
worker database URL or sink token.
