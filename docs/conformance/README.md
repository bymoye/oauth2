# Product-owned black-box records

This directory retains NazoAuth protocol regression contracts and Markdown
evidence from external black-box validation. OIDF evidence belongs with the
product whose behavior it verifies. It does not introduce validator-specific
server routes, schema, configuration, credentials, orchestration or runtime
evidence formats.

The RFC 9967 SCIM SET matrix is a project-owned executable black-box contract.

Third-party validators are ordinary external clients; they do not create a
server-side protocol or evidence exception.

## External OIDF evidence

- [2026-09-06 Direct TLS and trusted proxy candidate acceptance](oidf-2026-09-06-dual-mode-candidate.md)
  records actual binary identities, original outcomes, manual review, cleanup,
  certificate lifecycle and signed evidence digests. Formal Release evidence is
  recorded separately once the distributed artifact has been verified.
